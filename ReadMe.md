# Resource Manager

## Overview

This toy program demonstrates the general resource manager using the shared pointer.

This repository is found in my personal code testing playground. I decided to recycle the code into something useful.

This is probably not the good approach, but I do hope you can find something useful.

## Requirement

|          | Requirement                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Language | C++11                         |
| Compiler | Any compiler capable of C++11 |
| CMake    | At least 3.1.0                |

## How to

Use CMake to build the library.

Normally there are no additional variable to configure.
